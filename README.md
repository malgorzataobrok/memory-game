I started programming during my maternity leave. That free time made me long for development and I realised that my previous occupations did not give me satisfaction just when it comes to possibilities to develop and did not allow me to feel that I was doing something interesting. I am a person who has always needed to deepen my knowledge, take part in trainings, conferences, get busy with field that gives opportunities to stay with it and not to "get stuck" in one place. I realised how important that is for me. That's why I decided to start learning programming. I would like to do it professionally and be able to have one career path which I will follow and keep getting better. Being a programmer allows to develop widely which gives me a great satisfaction and the satisfaction of doing interesting things, which are appreciated, motivates me to work effectively as well as makes work a pleasure. Another small thing is possibility to create things. Who doesn't like to make something that works from scratch ðŸ˜Š
